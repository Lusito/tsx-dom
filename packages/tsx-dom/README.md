# tsx-dom

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Lusito/tsx-dom/blob/master/LICENSE)

A simple way to use tsx syntax to create native dom elements using document.createElement.
This project has taken definitions from [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) from Jason Miller as a starting point.

## Why?

I work on a couple of web-extensions. These extensions have no server side, so creating a UI needs to be done with HTML or JavaScript. Since React and the likes add to the size of the project and are not as performant as I need them to be (especially on older mobile devices), I needed a different approach to split the UI into components to keep it manageable.
Also using innerHTML and the likes should be forbidden, since it's not allowed in the mozilla review processes.

This project allows you to create a UI using react-like components, without including react.

## Installation via NPM

```npm i tsx-dom```

Enable TSX parsing in your tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react",
    "jsxFactory": "h",
    ...
```

Or with the new JSX Transform:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "tsx-dom",
    ...
  },
```

## Configuration

By default, support for HTML and SVG Elements is enabled. You can limit this
(for example to do less casting or to prevent certain tags from being used)
by creating a `d.ts` file (e.g. `tsx-dom-config.d.ts`), in your source folder with this content:

```ts
import 'tsx-dom';

declare module "tsx-dom" {
    export interface TsxConfig {
        // Set one of these to false to disable support for them
        svg: false;
        // html: false;
    }
}
```

Setting any of these to false will just limit the possible types. It does not affect the code in any way.

## Plain dom elements

```TypeScript
// This import is required
import { h } from "tsx-dom";

// jsx tags (<...>) always return an HTMLElement, so cast it to whatever type you need
const myImg = <img src="my/path.png" onClick={() => console.log("click")} /> as HTMLImageElement;

// Use it like any element created with document.createElement(...);
document.body.appendChild(myImg);
```

## Attributes and event handlers

Attributes on plain dom starting with a lowercase "on" will be added as event listeners. If the attribute ends with "Capture", then the capture parameter will be set to true. For example `onClickCapture={fn}` will result in `element.addEventListener("click", fn, true)`.

Other attributes will be set via `element.setAttribute()`. Passing `true` as a value is the same as passing the attribute name as value.

## Functional components

Just like in react, functional components can be used when they are written in UpperCamelCase.
If you define an interface for the props, the props will be type checked.

```TypeScript
import { h } from "tsx-dom";

interface ImageButtonProps {
    src: string;
    label: string;
}

export function ImageButton({ src, label }: ImageButtonProps) {
    return <button><img src={src} /> {label}</button>;
}

document.body.appendChild(<ImageButton src="danger.png" label="Will Robinson"/>);
```

## Children

Functional Components can of course have children, so you could write the above like this:

```TypeScript
import { h, BaseProps } from "tsx-dom";

interface ImageButtonProps extends BaseProps {
    src: string;
}

export function ImageButton({ src, children }: ImageButtonProps) {
    return <button><img src={src} /> {children}</button>;
}

document.body.appendChild(<ImageButton src="danger.png">Will Robinson</ImageButton>);
```

## Types of children

In dom elements and Functional components, you can add as many children as you like.

```TypeScript
const danger = "Danger"; // Try: ["Whoop", "Dee", "Doo", 0, 1, 2]
const el = <div>
    <img src="danger.png" />
    Will Robinson,
    {danger}
    <b>!!!</b>
</div>;
```

As you can see in the example above, even variables can be inserted as children. Arrays will be expanded. Falsey values (except 0) will be ignored. HTMLElement values will be appended as is, string or number values will become text-nodes.
