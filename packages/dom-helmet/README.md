A document head manager for plain dom (inspired by [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)).

It can be used on a generated DOM tree to adjust the topmost head, body and html tags.
This can be useful in server-side-rendering when component logic needs to adjust the head, body or html tag.

## How to Use

Check out the [documentation](https://lusito.github.io/tsx-dom/dom-helmet/setup.html)
